1) Write a function that computes the factorial of a nonnegative integers
2) Write a function that computes binomial coefficients
3) Write a function that computing the square root of a floating number
4) Write a function that checks a number for primality
5) Write a function that takes as input a list of numbers and outputs the average of this list
Notes:
1) The functions must be robust. For example, if we try to compute the factorial of 0.5, it should give an error.
2) Try to think about efficiency, for example, the definition of something might not be the most efficient way 
to program the function (for example the binomial coefficients in (2)).

Run the following code:

Making field of order 2:

R = Modulo(2)  

Arithmetic in the field:

R(1) + R(1)
R(1)*R(1)

Making field of order 11:

S = Modulo(11)

Arithmetic in the field:

Invert(S(4))
S(4) / S(3)

Ask about properties of the underlying structure

IsCommutativeRing(S(4)) 
^ask wheter S(4) is an element of a commutative ring

Zero(S(4))
^Returns the zero element of the field of S(4)
